In the project I aimed to predict uber stock prices. Using public data on their website, I performed data cleaning and the data was quite cleaning not needing much ETL processes. I created a correlation matrix to establish the strength of the relationships within the variables. I splitted data into training and testing where i used around 80% for training. I used the decision tree regressor alogarithim to make predictions. I later calculated the score of the model which performed quite well having a model performance of 99%.
