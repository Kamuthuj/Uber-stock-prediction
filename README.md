In the project I aimed to predict uber stock prices. Using public data on their website, I performed data cleaning and extracted new columns such as individual years and months.I was able to see how trading volumes changed over the months. I created a correlation matrix to establish the strength of the relationships within the variables. I splitted data into training and testing where i used around 80% for training. 



I used the linear regression and decision tree model to train the data. Both models performed equally the same givng a mean squared error of about  3.067.
